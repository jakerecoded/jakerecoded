- 👋 Hi, I’m @jakerecoded
- 👀 I’m interested in international relations, security, geopolitics, conflict, and intelligence (and how all of those areas still have terrible, terrible tech stacks). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning vanilla Javascript, Typescript, React, Node.js, Django and Python. Initially running through Codecademy, likely to be followed by Scrimba, The Odin Project and React.gg.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects which relate to conflict, international security, and intelligence.
- 📫 Drop me a line on Github or LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakehernandez/.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I think I was once a country's only confirmed Swine Flu case.
