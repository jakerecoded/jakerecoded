- 👋 Hi, I’m @jakerecoded
- 👀 I’m interested in international relations, security, geopolitics, conflict, and intelligence (and how all of those areas still have terrible, terrible tech stacks). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning vanilla Javascript, React, Node.js, Django and Python. Initially running through Codecademy, likely to be followed by The Odin Project and React.gg.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects which relate to conflict, international security, and intelligence.
- 📫 Drop me a line on Github or LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakehernandez/.
